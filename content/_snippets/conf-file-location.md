The [recommended installation](install-divvyd.html) uses the config file `/etc/opt/divvy/divvyd.cfg` by default. Other places you can put a config file include `$HOME/.config/divvy/divvyd.cfg` (where `$HOME` is the home directory of the user running `divvyd`), `$HOME/.local/divvy/divvyd.cfg`, or the current working directory from where you start `divvyd`.
