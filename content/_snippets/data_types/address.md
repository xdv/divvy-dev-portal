Accounts in the XDV Ledger are identified by a base58 XDV Ledger Address. The address is derived from the account's master [public key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography), which is in turn derived from a secret key. An address is represented as a string in JSON and has the following characteristics:

* Between 25 and 35 characters in length
* Starts with the character `r`
* Uses alphanumeric characters, excluding the number "`0`" capital letter "`O`", capital letter "`I`", and lowercase letter "`l`"
* Case-sensitive
* Includes a 4-byte checksum so that the probability of generating a valid address from random characters is approximately 1 in 2^32
