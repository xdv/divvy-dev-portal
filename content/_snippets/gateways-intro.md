Gateways are businesses that provide a way for money and other forms of value to move in and out of the XDV Ledger. There are three major models that gateways can follow, with different purposes and modes of operation.

* An **Issuing Gateway** receives money (or other assets of value) outside of the XDV Ledger, and creates issuances in the XDV Ledger. This provides a direct way for customers to get money in and out of the XDV Ledger. All currencies in the XDV Ledger, except for XDV, take the form of issuances tied to a specific issuing gateway.
* A **Private Exchange** holds XDV and lets its customers buy and sell that XDV in its own system. Most cryptocurrencies rely on private exchanges to provide a market for the cryptocurrency, but the XDV Ledger has a currency exchange built into the protocol itself.
* **Merchants** accept payment within the XDV Ledger in exchange for goods and services in the outside world. Currently, Divvy (the company) does provide support for merchant operations using the XDV Ledger.
