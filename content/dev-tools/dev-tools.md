Divvy provides a set of developer tools to help you test, explore, and validate XDV Ledger API requests and behavior.

* **[XDV Ledger Lookup Tool](xdv-ledger-rpc-tool.html)**

      Use this JSON-RPC-based debugging tool to print raw information about a XDV Ledger account, transaction, or ledger.

* **[XDV Ledger Test Net Faucet](xdv-test-net-faucet.html)**

      Use the WebSocket and JSON-RPC Test Net endpoints to test software built on the XDV Ledger without using real funds. Generate Test Net credentials and funds for testing purposes. Test net ledger and balances are reset on a regular basis.
<!--{# TODO: For information about how to connect your `divvyd` test server to the Test Net, see [XXXXX](x). #}-->

* **[divvyd API WebSocket Tool](websocket-api-tool.html)**

      Need to see the divvyd API in action ASAP? Use this tool to send prepopulated sample requests and get responses. No setup required.
<!--{# TODO: which methods are surfaced here -- is this all of them? #}-->

* **[Data API v2 Tool](data-api-v2-tool.html)**

      Need to see the Data API v2 in action ASAP? Use this tool to send prepopulated sample requests and get responses. No setup required.

* **[divvyd.txt Validator](divvy-txt-validator.html)**

      Use this tool to verify that your `divvy.txt` is syntactically correct and deployed properly.
