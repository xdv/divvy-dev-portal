# base58 Encodings

The `divvyd` APIs often use a [base58](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base58) encoding with a checksum (sometimes called "Base58Check") to represent [account addresses](accounts.html#addresses) and other types of values related to cryptographic keys. This encoding is the same as the one used for Bitcoin addresses, except that the XDV Ledger uses the following dictionary: `dpshnaf39wBUDNEGHJKLM4PQRST7VWXYZ2bcreCg65jkm8oFqi1tuvAxyz`.

The XDV Ledger prefixes different types of values with a specific 8-bit number before encoding them to distinguish between different data types. Combined with the arrangement of characters in the XDV Ledger's base58 dictionary, the result is that the base58 representations for different types of encoded values start with specific letters by type.

The following table lists all the encodings the XDV Ledger uses:

| Data Type                    | Starts With | Type Prefix | Content size¹ | Maximum characters |
|:-----------------------------|:------------|:---------------|:--------------|:--|
| [Account][] address          | r           | `0x00`         | 20 bytes      | 35 |
| Account public key           | a           | `0x23`         | 33 bytes      | 53 |
| Seed value (for secret keys) | s           | `0x21`         | 16 bytes      | 29 |
| Validation public key        | n           | `0x1C`         | 33 bytes      | 53 |

¹ Content size excludes the 1-byte type prefix.
