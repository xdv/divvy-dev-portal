# Ledger Object IDs
<a id="sha512half"></a>

All objects in a ledger's state tree have a unique ID. This field is returned as the `index` field in JSON, at the same level as the object's contents. The ID is derived by hashing important contents of the object, along with a [namespace identifier](https://github.com/xdv/divvyd/blob/master/src/divvy/protocol/LedgerFormats.h#L99). The [ledger object type](ledger-object-types.html) determines which namespace identifier to use and which contents to include in the hash. This ensures every ID is unique. To calculate the hash, `divvyd` uses SHA-512 and then truncates the result to the first 256 bits. This algorithm, informally called **SHA-512Half**, provides an output that has comparable security to SHA-256, but runs faster on 64-bit processors.
