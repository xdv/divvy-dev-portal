## AccountRoot Flags

There are several options which can be either enabled or disabled for an account. These options can be changed with an [AccountSet transaction][]. In the ledger, flags are represented as binary values that can be combined with bitwise-or operations. The bit values for the flags in the ledger are different than the values used to enable or disable those flags in a transaction. Ledger flags have names that begin with _lsf_.

AccountRoot objects can have the following flag values:

| Flag Name | Hex Value | Decimal Value | Description | Corresponding [AccountSet Flag](accountset.html#accountset-flags) |
|-----------|-----------|---------------|-------------|-------------------------------|
| lsfDefaultDivvy | 0x00800000 | 8388608 | Enable [divvying](divvying.html) on this addresses's trust lines by default. Required for issuing addresses; discouraged for others. | asfDefaultDivvy |
| lsfDepositAuth | 0x01000000 | 16777216 | This account can only receive funds from transactions it sends, and from [preauthorized](depositauth.html#preauthorization) accounts. (It has [DepositAuth](depositauth.html) enabled.) | asfDepositAuth |
| lsfDisableMaster | 0x00100000 | 1048576 | Disallows use of the master key to sign transactions for this account. | asfDisableMaster |
| lsfDisallowXDV | 0x00080000 | 524288 | Client applications should not send XDV to this account. Not enforced by `divvyd`. | asfDisallowXDV |
| lsfGlobalFreeze | 0x00400000 | 4194304 | All assets issued by this address are frozen. | asfGlobalFreeze |
| lsfNoFreeze | 0x00200000 | 2097152 | This address cannot freeze trust lines connected to it. Once enabled, cannot be disabled. | asfNoFreeze |
| lsfPasswordSpent | 0x00010000 | 65536 | The account has used its free SetRegularKey transaction. | (None) |
| lsfRequireAuth | 0x00040000 | 262144 | This account must individually approve other users for those users to hold this account's issuances. | asfRequireAuth |

## AccountRoot ID Format

The ID of an AccountRoot object is the [SHA-512Half][] of the following values, concatenated in order:

* The Account space key (`0x0061`)
* The AccountID of the account
