|:------------------|:-----------------|:------------------|:------------------|
| BaseFee           | String           | UInt64            | The charge, in drops of XDV, for the reference transaction, as hex. (This is the [transaction cost](transaction-cost.html) before scaling for load.) |
| ReferenceFeeUnits | Unsigned Integer | UInt32            | The cost, in fee units, of the reference transaction |
| ReserveBase       | Unsigned Integer | UInt32            | The base reserve, in drops |
| ReserveIncrement  | Unsigned Integer | UInt32            | The incremental reserve, in drops |
| LedgerSequence    | Number           | UInt32            | The index of the ledger version where this pseudo-transaction appears. This distinguishes the pseudo-transaction from other occurrences of the same change. |
