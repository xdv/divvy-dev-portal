# System Requirements

## Minimum Specifications

A `divvyd` server should run comfortably on commodity hardware, to make it inexpensive to participate in the network. At present, Divvy recommends the following minimum requirements:

- Operating System:
    - Production: CentOS or RedHat Enterprise Linux (latest release) or Ubuntu (16.04+) supported
    - Development: Mac OS X, Windows (64-bit), or most Linux distributions
- CPU: 64-bit x86_64, 2+ cores
- Disk: Minimum 50GB for the database partition. SSD strongly recommended (minimum 1000 IOPS, more is better)
- RAM: 8GB+

Amazon EC2's `m3.large` VM size may be appropriate depending on your workload. A fast network connection is preferable. Any increase in a server's client-handling load increases resources needs.

## Recommended Specifications

For best performance in enterprise production environments, Divvy recommends running `divvyd` on bare metal with the following characteristics:

- Operating System: Ubuntu 16.04+
- CPU: Intel Xeon 3+ GHz processor with 4 cores and hyperthreading enabled
- Disk: SSD (7000+ writes/second, 10,000+ reads/second)
- RAM:
  	- For testing: 8GB+
  	- For production: 32GB
- Network: Enterprise data center network with a gigabit network interface on the host
